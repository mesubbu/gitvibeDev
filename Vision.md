# GitVibe — Project Vision

GitVibe is designed as a self-hosted, AI-native development platform
that empowers developers to work in creative flow using intelligent tools.

This document outlines long-term exploratory directions.
It does not represent guaranteed features or timelines.

---

## Design Principles

- Privacy-first by default
- Self-hosted ownership
- Modular extensibility
- Local AI support
- Developer flow optimization

All future work will follow these principles.

---

## Exploratory Directions

### 1. Voice-Driven Interaction

Investigating optional voice-based navigation for common Git and
GitHub operations, with full local processing.

Example use cases:
- Querying repositories
- Triggering reviews
- Navigating pull requests

---

### 2. Agent Orchestration

Exploring deeper integration with external and internal agent
frameworks to enable multi-agent collaboration, mediation,
and automated workflows.(clawbot,nanobot,picobot etc)

---

### 3. Lightweight AI Modes

Researching support for ultra-lightweight local models for
low-resource and air-gapped environments.(II-Agent, Smaller Gemma models etc)

---

### 4. Multimodal Development Tools

Studying ways to combine text, voice, and visual representations
to improve code comprehension and project exploration.

---

### 5. Repository Knowledge Systems

Experimenting with graph-based and semantic representations
of repository history, structure, and collaboration patterns.

---

## Community Involvement

GitVibe welcomes community feedback and experimentation.

Proposed ideas may evolve, be revised, or be discontinued
based on feasibility, security, and user needs.

---

## Commitment

GitVibe prioritizes stability, transparency, and user control
over rapid feature expansion.

Experimental features will remain optional and modular.
