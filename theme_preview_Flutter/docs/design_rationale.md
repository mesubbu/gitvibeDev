# Design Rationale

The visual system is optimized for SaaS review operations:

- neutral surfaces to prioritize code/review artifacts,
- high-contrast status semantics,
- tokenized scale system for compact/comfortable modes,
- role-aware accents to orient high-risk operations.

Three theme variants are intentionally provided:

- **Variant A (Balanced)**: default product posture,
- **Variant B (High Contrast)**: operations-heavy and accessibility-forward,
- **Variant C (Calm Focus)**: long-form review and reduced visual fatigue.
