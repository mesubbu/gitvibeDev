# UX Principles

1. **Context Before Action**
   - Users must understand state before committing irreversible operations.
2. **Role-Aware Simplicity**
   - Expose only capabilities relevant to current role and intent.
3. **Progressive Power**
   - Advanced controls stay discoverable but not intrusive.
4. **Fail Loud, Recover Fast**
   - Errors are explicit, actionable, and retry-oriented.
5. **Operational Transparency**
   - Job status, AI outcomes, and policy state remain visible.
6. **Keyboard + Density Parity**
   - Power workflows remain fast with high information density options.
