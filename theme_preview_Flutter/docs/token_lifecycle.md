# Token Lifecycle

## Stages

1. **Draft** — Introduced in Theme Lab
2. **Candidate** — Used in at least one realistic scenario
3. **Adopted** — Promoted to shared design tokens
4. **Deprecated** — Superseded with migration path
5. **Retired** — Removed after compatibility window

## Rules

- Every token change must include semantic intent.
- Deprecated tokens require aliasing during migration window.
- Component-level hardcoded values are prohibited.
